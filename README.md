#Impact
Impact an algorithm for figuring out where two 3D meshes collide in space. The code for impact is contained in `physics.js`. This implementation is built on top of `three.js`. There is a demo of the translational collision prediction contained in `demo.html`. The demo uses the following third party libraries `stats.js`, `three.js` and `controls.js`.
